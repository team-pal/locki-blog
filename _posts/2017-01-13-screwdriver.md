title: Screwdriver.cd released with bilingual documentation by Locki
---

Yahoo's open-source project [Screwdriver](http://screwdriver.cd/), a Continuous Delivery Build System for Dynamic Infrastructure, was just [released](https://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/155765242061/open-sourcing-screwdriver-yahoos-continuous) with all product [docs available in English and Japanese](http://docs.screwdriver.cd).

This community-driven tool will simplify deployment pipelines, optimize for trunk development, and make rolling back easier. Screwdriver handles over 25,000+ builds per day and 12,000+ daily git commits as a single shared entrypoint for Yahoo. It supports multiple languages and handles both virtual machine and container-based builds and deployment.

While Yahoo has been filling the headlines with drastic strategic decisions lately, we are very proud to support Yahoo's open-source project and take the collaborative results to new places in the world.

Thanks to a supportive community and its collaborative translation integrated with Locki, Screwdriver docs are now available to developers in 2 languages.

### We wish Screwdriver.cd continuous success, with continuous and additional language support!
