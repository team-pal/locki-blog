This community-driven tool will simplify deployment pipelines, optimize for trunk development, and make rolling back easier. Screwdriver handles over 25,000+ builds per day and 12,000+ daily git commits as a single shared entrypoint for Yahoo. It supports multiple languages and handles both virtual machine and container-based builds and deployment.

Thanks to a supportive community and its collaborative translation integrated with Locki, Screwdriver docs are now available to developers in Japanese as well. We have worked with Screwdriver's local team in Tokyo on making the latest Continuous Delivery solutions available to Japanese developers in their native language, instantly.

### We wish Screwdriver.cd continuous success, with continuous and additional language support!
